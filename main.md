# Understanding epithelium mechanics at the cell level

## Epithelial morphogenesis

> Simple mechanics are often  enough

## Role of apoptosis in fold formation

# The `tyssue` library

## Design and architecture

![](images/data_model.png)


> Modular design widens the range of applications

## A gallery

* Fold formation
* Mesoderm invagination
* Rheology
* Organoid

## Open questions

* Pseudo stratified
* Role of the ECM?
* Mesenchymal cells

> Still work to do to capture a lot of biology

# Force inference and model fitting

## 2D segementation

* Detection method
* Model reconstruction

> Pretty standard methods

## Force inference and model fitting

* Method
* First results

>

## Perspectives

* Towards 3D



# Tyssue

* Microscopy data to models
* Models as virtual experiments
* Models as parameter spaces
